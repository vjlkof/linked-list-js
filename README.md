# linked-list-js

This is a linked list training

You will need two classes or factories:

[DOONE] 1- LinkedList class / factory, which will represent the full list.
[DONE] 2- Node class / factory, containing a value property and a link to the nextNode, set both as null by default.
Build the following functions in your linked list class:
[DONE] 1- append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
[DONE] 2- prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
[DONE] 3- size returns the total number of nodes in the list
[DONE] 4- head returns the first node in the list
[DONE] 5- tail returns the last node in the list
[DONE] 6- at(index) returns the node at the given index
[DONE] 7- pop removes the last element from the list
[DONE] 8- contains(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
[DONE] 9- find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
[DONE] 10- toString represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null

Extra credit
[DONE] 1- insertAt(value, index) that inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
[] 2- removeAt(index) that removes the node at the given index.
[DONE] 3- Extra Credit Tip: When you insert or remove a node, consider how it will affect the existing nodes. Some of the nodes will need their nextNode link updated.
